# reactNativeCamp
A React-Native application for Nucamp

## Description

This is a React-Native application created for my Nucamp class to be used in conjunction with the MongoDB server that we also built during our bootcamp. 

## Usage
The user can view various campsites, partners and promotions (fetched from the MongoDB database) and mark them as their "favorites."
